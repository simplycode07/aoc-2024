## Solutions to Advent of Code 2023

This is repo of my Solutions for Advent of Code, I know it is a bit unorganised but I'll organise it ~~never~~ later.

### Step To Run:-
-   Copy and Paste input to input.txt
-   Run the program by `python day{date}_{part}.py` replace {date} with date and {part} with part you want to run.
e.g. `python day6_1.py`
